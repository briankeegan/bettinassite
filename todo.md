- about, port, contact and instagram icon(too high up as well) are spaced weird 
- footer and header should be the same height?
- the message box in contacts is broken when enlarged

-- make it mobile ready
- menu needs to appear when ipad or phone size
- menu underline wont go away
- remove menu hamburger when dropdown is clicked
- cant affect font
